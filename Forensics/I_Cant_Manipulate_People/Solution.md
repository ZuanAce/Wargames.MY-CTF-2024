## Approach
When I opened the .pcap file in Wireshark, I noticed a lot of ICMP echo requests (ping packets).

Looking at the data section in these packets, I saw something interestingâ€”it started with WGMY{.... This meant the flag was hidden in the data payloads of the ICMP packets.

To get the flag, I needed to:
- Extract the data payloads from ICMP echo requests.
- Join the payloads into one long string.
- Convert the hexadecimal string into readable text (ASCII).

I used this command to do it:
`tshark -r traffic.pcap -Y "icmp.type == 8" -T fields -e data | tr -d '\n' | xxd -r -p`

> [!NOTE]  
> `tshark`: Filters the ICMP packets and gets the data field.
>
> `tr -d '\n'`: Joins all the hex values into one line.
> 
> `xxd -r -p`: Converts the hex string into readable text.

And finally, this gave me the flag hidden in the packets.
