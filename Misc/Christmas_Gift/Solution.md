## Approach
Running exiftool revealed the GIF had 1402 frames. With so many frames, it was clear the flag was hidden in one of them.

When faced with the task of extracting frames from a GIF, I explored a few potential approaches via ChatGPT:
- Using Python with Pillow (PIL)
- Using FFmpeg
- Online tools like ezgif
After some thought, I opted for the Python methodâ€”it felt both efficient and satisfying for the task.

Here's the script I used:
```python
from PIL import Image
import os

def extract_frames(gif_path, output_folder):
    os.makedirs(output_folder, exist_ok=True)
    with Image.open(gif_path) as img:
        for frame in range(img.n_frames):
            img.seek(frame)
            frame_path = os.path.join(output_folder, f"frame_{frame}.png")
            img.save(frame_path)
            print(f"Saved {frame_path}")

extract_frames("gift.gif", "output_frames")
```
> [!NOTE]  
> Install the Pillow library: `pip install pillow`
> 
> Save the script in the same directory as gift.gif.

Then, run it, and it will save all the frames in an output_frames folder.

After extracting the frames, I carefully checked them one by one. Finally, at frame 1042, there it was, the hidden flag!
