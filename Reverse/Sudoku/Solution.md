## Approach
Unzip sudoku.zip reveals to file namely `out.enc` and `sudoku`.

Running the `file` command on sudoku does not give much information. I tried opening the file using [Decompiler Explorer](https://dogbolt.org/) and it shows `error: file to large`. 


Then, I used the `strings` command, and i found something at the end: `pydata`, seems like the program is definitely compiled using python

Exploring and researching leads me to [PyInstaller Extractor WEB](https://pyinstxtractor-web.netlify.app/).

```
[+] Please stand by...

You can now use a python decompiler on the pyc files within the extracted directory
[+] Extraction completed successfully, downloading zip
```

At, the `sudoku_extracted folder`, there are many files extracted. However, we only need to decompile `sudoku.pyc`.

Then, i used [Pylingual](https://pylingual.io/) to decompile `sudoku.pyc`:

However, changing the extension to `.jpg` didnâ€™t help at all ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡. When I tried opening the file, I encountered the error:
`error interpreting jpeg image file (bogus huffman table definition)`.

> [!NOTE]  
> The error message error interpreting JPEG image file (bogus Huffman table definition) indicates that there might be a corruption or unexpected data in the JPEG file.
> This is often caused by deliberate manipulation (e.g., in CTF challenges) or a problem with the file itself.

I ran exiftool to dig deeper, and noticed a strange warning: `[minor] Skipped unknown 4 bytes after JPEG APP0 segment`.

This suggested there was extra, possibly unwanted data in the JPEG file. To understand the warning better, I seeked help from ChatGPT.

> [!NOTE] 
> What the Warning Means:
> - JPEG APP0 Segment: This is part of the JPEG header and is typically used to store metadata, such as JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format) or Exif information.
> - Unknown Bytes: The extra 4 bytes found in this segment are not standard or expected according to the JPEG specification.

I then used `strings` to extract readable text from the file and, to my surprise, found an endless stream of "meows." It dawned on me: the challenge was named "Unwanted Meow," so maybe removing these "meows" would help restore the file.

Next, I used `sed` to remove all instances of "meow" from the file: `sed 's/meow//g' flag.shredded > cleaned_flag.jpg`

> [!NOTE] 
> - s/meow//g: Replaces all occurrences of "meow" with nothing (removes them).
> - cleaned_flag.jpg: The cleaned file without "meow".

After running this command, the image was now visible, but still distorted.

A second round of cleaning was needed. I ran the same sed command again on the already cleaned file: `sed 's/meow//g' cleaned_flag.jpg > very_cleaned_flag.jpg`

This time, the image finally displayed correctly, and there it was, the long-awaited flag. ðŸŽ‰
